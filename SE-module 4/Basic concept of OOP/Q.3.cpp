/*What is the difference between OOP and POP?*/


/*Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):-
> OOP treats data as a critical element in the program development and does not allow it to flow freely around the system.
> In OOP, the major emphasis is on data rather than procedure (function).
> It ties data more closely to the function that operate on it, and protects it from accidental modification from outside function.
> OOP allows decomposition of a problem into a number of entities called objects and then builds data and function around these objects
> C++, Java, Dot Net, Python etc are the example of Object oriented programming (OOP) language.

Features of OOP (Object Oriented Programming):-

1.Class
2.Object
3.Encapsulation
4.Data Abstraction
5.Inheritance
6.Polymorphism
7.Data binding
8.Message Passing

Procedural Oriented Programming (POP):-
> In the procedure oriented approach, large programs are divided into smaller programs known as functions.
> In POP, a program is written as a sequence of procedures or function.
> In POP, each procedure (function) contains a series of instructions for performing a specific task
> During the program execution each procedure (function) can be called by the other procedures.
> In POP, the major emphasis is on procedure (function) and not on the data
